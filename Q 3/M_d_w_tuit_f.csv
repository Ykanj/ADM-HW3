Developmental Transactional Analysis [DTA],Professional Development International,Postgraduate Work-based Learning,['Part Time'],"Transactional analysis is often associated with its pop psychology image of the hippy era – but since the ‘sixties it has continued to develop as a profession and is now practised worldwide and in many contexts. This programme concentrates on developmental applications, relating to individual, group and organisational contexts rather than the original focus on psychotherapy. It is suitable, therefore, for professionals such as consultants, educators, coaches, counsellors, managers – anyone with responsibility for the development of others (rather than ‘cure’).  The training is rigorous, with 4-5 years being a typical time frame to obtain international accreditation, so sits well alongside postgraduate qualifications. It is also work-based, with the requirement to demonstrate competent application of TA in the development of others, so we use a series of portfolio submissions based on your professional interventions, with no need for artificial projects to be set up.  Our modules relate to professional areas of practice, so for the first level thsese are Professional Intervention, Core Themes of TA, Individual Development, Interactions & Relationships, Group Processes and Organisations & Institutions. After that, the focus shifts to the context, to practitioner skills such as facilitating, learning, etc, process skills and research awareness. The final MSc level requires implementation of a research-based case study typical of your professional practice.  Our programmes are recognized for accreditation by the international TA associations. They can also be linked to accreditation by the European Mentoring & Coaching Council (EMCC) at Practitioner or Masters Practitioner level; and to the Chartered Management Institute (CMI) and the Institute of Leadership & Management (ILM).  More details of the various TA qualifications, and how this programme fits, can be seen at http://www.pifcic.org  Faculty  Our faculty comprises internationally-accredited experts within the TA community, who have wide experience of applying TA professionally in many different contexts. Refer to our prospectus via the link above for further details.  Flexible Study to suit your Lifestyle  The programme is offered via webinars that allow interaction with tutors and with other participants, supplemented with occasional workshops arranged in various countries to suit demand. We have some national groups where students come together to attend the webinars. There are also options to attend regular workshops with our faculty in the UK, Netherlands, New Zealand and Romania, and in other countries through our non-faculty international TA colleagues.",Any Month,,"PGDip,MSc,PGCert",8 mths to 3-4 years depending on qualification,London,United Kingdom,Online,https://www.findamasters.com/masters-degrees/course/developmental-transactional-analysis-dta/?i1689d6854c34353,transact analysi often associ pop psycholog imag hippi era – sinc ‘ sixti continu develop profess practis worldwid mani context programm concentr development applic relat individu group organis context rather origin focu psychotherapi suitabl therefor profession consult educ coach counsellor manag – anyon respons develop other rather ‘ cure ’ train rigor 45 year typic time frame obtain intern accredit sit well alongsid postgradu qualif also workbas requir demonstr compet applic ta develop other use seri portfolio submiss base profession intervent need artifici project set modul relat profession area practic first level thsese profession intervent core theme ta individu develop interact relationship group process organis institut focu shift context practition skill facilit learn etc process skill research awar final msc level requir implement researchbas case studi typic profession practic programm recogn accredit intern ta associ also link accredit european mentor coach council emcc practition master practition level charter manag institut cmi institut leadership manag ilm detail variou ta qualif programm fit seen httpwwwpifcicorg faculti faculti compris internationallyaccredit expert within ta commun wide experi appli ta profession mani differ context refer prospectu via link detail flexibl studi suit lifestyl programm offer via webinar allow interact tutor particip supplement occasion workshop arrang variou countri suit demand nation group student come togeth attend webinar also option attend regular workshop faculti uk netherland new zealand romania countri nonfaculti intern ta colleagu,development transact analysi dta,profession develop intern,london,

Our MissionThe power of science to change the face of modern society is growing at an ever increasing pace. Science and technology are tools that can and do improve the human condition in many ways. But the rapid pace of change also brings unforeseen consequences and perils. Science and technology cannot develop effectively within a social vacuum. The objective of this program is to train students not only in the advanced methods of science, but to place this body of knowledge in the broader context of modern society. In addition to conducting research in the BioSciences, our graduate students receive advanced training in both the technology and policy dimensions of science providing every student with a skill set that prepares them to work in both academia and industry at an advanced level in every area of biology. Our GoalsOur educational objectives are four-fold. First, we provide our students with an applied education in the methods of science. Second, we educate our students in the methods of scientific literacy. Third, we educate our students on the relationship between science and the community around us. This will involve the study of science and ethics, and science and the development of public policy.

﻿Developmental Transactional Analysis [DTA],Professional Development International,Postgraduate Work-based Learning,['Part Time'],"Transactional analysis is often associated with its pop psychology image of the hippy era – but since the ‘sixties it has continued to develop as a profession and is now practised worldwide and in many contexts. This programme concentrates on developmental applications, relating to individual, group and organisational contexts rather than the original focus on psychotherapy. It is suitable, therefore, for professionals such as consultants, educators, coaches, counsellors, managers – anyone with responsibility for the development of others (rather than ‘cure’).  The training is rigorous, with 4-5 years being a typical time frame to obtain international accreditation, so sits well alongside postgraduate qualifications. It is also work-based, with the requirement to demonstrate competent application of TA in the development of others, so we use a series of portfolio submissions based on your professional interventions, with no need for artificial projects to be set up.  Our modules relate to professional areas of practice, so for the first level thsese are Professional Intervention, Core Themes of TA, Individual Development, Interactions & Relationships, Group Processes and Organisations & Institutions. After that, the focus shifts to the context, to practitioner skills such as facilitating, learning, etc, process skills and research awareness. The final MSc level requires implementation of a research-based case study typical of your professional practice.  Our programmes are recognized for accreditation by the international TA associations. They can also be linked to accreditation by the European Mentoring & Coaching Council (EMCC) at Practitioner or Masters Practitioner level; and to the Chartered Management Institute (CMI) and the Institute of Leadership & Management (ILM).  More details of the various TA qualifications, and how this programme fits, can be seen at http://www.pifcic.org  Faculty  Our faculty comprises internationally-accredited experts within the TA community, who have wide experience of applying TA professionally in many different contexts. Refer to our prospectus via the link above for further details.  Flexible Study to suit your Lifestyle  The programme is offered via webinars that allow interaction with tutors and with other participants, supplemented with occasional workshops arranged in various countries to suit demand.
