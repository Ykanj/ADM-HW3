              Food security is concerned with the availability, access, and utilisation of safe, nutritious and sustainable food to all, especially vulnerable groups within society.
             

              The challenges related to food are not only the existence of approximately 795 million undernourished people in the world (Food and Agricultural Organization) but also:
             


               the increasing presence of diet-related, non-communicable diseases (e.g. diabetes and heart disease)
              

               the contribution of agriculture to greenhouse gas emissions
              

               land use change
              


              Understanding the interconnection of food, health and the environment, as well as their trade-offs, is vital to formulate policies that enable us to achieve food security in a sustainable manner."
