Cyber Security - MSc	Newcastle University	Newcastle University	Full time & Part time	"Cyber Security is a dynamic area of computing science. It's about understanding:
             


               how the features and vulnerabilities of a system can be exploited by attackers
              

               how to detect, prevent and respond to these attackers
              


              Cyber Security is also a process, requiring input from and interaction with end-users, stakeholders, decision-makers or system designers.
             

              The MSc Cyber Security is designed for honours graduates in computing science, or a discipline with a significant computing component, for example:
             


               engineering
              

               systems engineering
              

               mathematics
              


              You should have a good background in computer systems, including programming. We also value relevant industrial computing experience and transferable skills."
