MASTER IN ECONOMICS	Collegio Carlo Alberto	Collegio Carlo Alberto	Full time	The Master in Economics continues the pioneering tradition of the Master in Economics created 20 years ago by the consortium Coripe Piemonte. That program, the first of its kind in Italy, prepared many bright Italian and foreign students, who now hold prominent academic or professional jobs in Italy or abroad. The new Master program in Economics builds on the strengths of the previous program and, at the same time, has been reshaped in order to compete with similar successful Master programs in Europe.
