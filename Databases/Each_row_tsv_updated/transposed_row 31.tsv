Bioinformatics MSc, PgDip	University of Edinburgh	University of Edinburgh	Full time	"Programme description
              


              Bioinformatics is an interdisciplinary field that develops methods and software tools for understanding biological data.
             

              As an interdisciplinary field of science, bioinformatics studies and processes biological data, combining:
             


               computer science
              

               informatics
              

               statistics/mathematics
              

               engineering
              


              The emphasis is on leveraging aspects of these disciplines to efficiently explore biology: it is BIO-informatics after all.
             

              The aim of the Bioinformatics MSc is to equip you with a strong background in biology, at the same time training you in the application and development of methods used to interpret the vast amounts of data generated by high-throughput 'omics' technologies, be they proteins or nucleic acids."
