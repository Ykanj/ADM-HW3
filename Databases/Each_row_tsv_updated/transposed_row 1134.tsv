Critical Care - MSc/PgDip/PgCert	University of Glasgow	University of Glasgow	Full time & Part time	"The care of critically ill patients is a challenging and highly specialised area of health care practice.
              


              The polio pandemic in the 1950s led to the birth of the modern Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Another pandemic (Covid-19) has seen the term ‘ICU’ rise to prominence once again as the area in hospital where the most severely ill patients are cared for. Critical Care is a term that is repeated daily in the media. It is the specialty we practice and are passionate about, and the area of health care we are dedicated to teaching at the University of Glasgow."
